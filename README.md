# Slant: Watch What You're Reading

This Chrome extension determines how slanted your news source is and displays a score in your browser's toolbar. 

### Summary
**How is the score calculated?**
Using the Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo slant score, media outlets are assigned a score of 0-100. Here is how the scale breaks down:

**0** : most conservative

**100** : most liberal

To find out more out, read about slant score on the [Freakanomics blog](http://goo.gl/olbFZM).

### Problem
I was drawn to the exploration of media bias since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. Images poured out from various media outlets of survivors scavenging for supplies. One picture set off a firestorm that showed one couple "finding supplies" while another showed a young black man "looting supplies."

### Solution
This is the idea for the project: to provide users with an accessible way to determine how biased their news sources are without ever leaving the page.

Currently, the extension monitors the slant from the following media outlets:
*ABC Good Morning America

*ABC World News Tonight
 
*CBS Early Show
 
*CBS Evening News

*CNN NewsNight with Aaron Brown
 
*Drudge Report
  
*Fox News Spec. Rept. w/ Brit Hume
 
*Los Angeles Times
  
*NBC Nightly News
  
*NBC Today Show 
 
*New York Times
 
*Newshour with Jim Lehrer

*Newsweek
 
*NPR Morning Edition
 
*Time Magazine 
 
*U.S. News and World Report
 
*USA Today
 
*Wall Street Journal 
 
*Washington Post
 
*Washington Times
